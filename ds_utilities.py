    This function is a utility wrapper around the Scikit-Learn train_test_split that splits arrays or 
    matrices into train, validation, and test subsets.
​
    Args:
        df (Pandas DataFrame): Dataframe with code.
        X (list): A list of features.
        y (str): A string with target column.
        train_size (float or int): Proportion of the dataset to include in the train split (0 to 1).
        val_size (float or int): Proportion of the dataset to include in the validation split (0 to 1).
        test_size (float or int): Proportion of the dataset to include in the test split (0 to 1).
        random_state (int): Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the split for reproducibility.
        shuffle (bool): Whether or not to shuffle the data before splitting
​
    Returns:
        Train, test, and validation dataframes for features (X) and target (y).
